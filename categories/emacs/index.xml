      <description>This week I participated at the emacs FFM Meetup where we talked about the idea of a chat bot extension for org-mode. I had to leave early, so I do not know what the results of the discussion were.
Nevertheless I did some thought on my own:
I would like to control everything I do in emacs from my mobile while I&#39;m on-the-go - not only org-mode related things.
On the emacs side one could utilise org-protocol which can be extended with additional protocol-handlers and despite the name it can also be used for things beside org-mode.</description>

      <title>Creating new Org Files for Hugo</title>

      <description>As the command `hugo new` does not work for org files I&#39;m using emacs for that task.
The code is based on what I found at Peter Smith&#39;s which seem to be based on the code from Tohojo.
First we&#39;ve to set the location where the blog source files are.
(setq hugo-base-dir &amp;#34;~/Documents/repo/TechBlog/&amp;#34;) Then we need the current time in two formats. The first for the name of the file we are creating and the second is used in the frontmatter.</description>
