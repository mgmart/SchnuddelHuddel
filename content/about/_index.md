This is the place where I write about random encounters in the world of
tech. I've decided to write this in English because it's the language which is
commonly used in the tech world. As you will easily see, it is not my
native tongue. If you encounter any mistakes, please let me know either by
comment or send me a message.

My other blog which is in German and mainly about long distance cycling could be
found [here](https://www.martelli.de)
