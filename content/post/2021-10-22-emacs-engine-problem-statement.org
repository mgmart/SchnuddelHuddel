This week I participated at the [[https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/emacs-ffm/][emacs FFM Meetup]] where we talked about the idea
of a chat bot extension for org-mode. I had to leave early, so I do not know
what the results of the discussion were.

Nevertheless I did some thought on my own:

I would like to control everything I do in emacs from my mobile while I'm
on-the-go - not only org-mode related things.

On the emacs side one could utilise org-protocol which can be extended with
additional protocol-handlers and despite the name it can also be used for things
beside org-mode.

The protocol could be fairly simple and the command could be reduced to: ~mode~ which is the sub-protocol, ~action~ and ~data~.

Some examples (not url-encoded for better readability):
#+begin_src c
org-protocol://sub-protocol?key=val&key2=val2
org-protocol://ledger?action=add&data=value:5,00â‚¬;account1:cash;account2:snacks;payee:Not Starbucks;comments:fine coffee
org-protocol://cal?action=list&data=from:today;for:1week
#+end_src

Any results could be written to a special file which would be used to inform the
user[fn:1].

The middleware-component which is here called ~emacs-engine~ could be e.g.
- a chat bot
- a gRPC client
- a REST client

So it would be possible to integrate ~emacs-engine~ into workflows implemented by Apple Shortcuts.

[fn:1] Therefore the communication channel used by the user must provide a backchannel.
