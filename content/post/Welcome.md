# Welcome to Byword 2

This new version brings a lot of new features and improvements. With Byword 2 we brought the iOS and Mac version closer together to provide a seamless writing, syncing and sharing experience. 

## Write
Byword for iOS provides a clean sheet and handy shortcuts to manipulate text. If you are into Markdown, Byword has features that help you perform most Markdown manipulations with lists, headings, links and images easily. When you are editing a document, swipe left and right on the toolbar above the keyboard to access the extended keyboard actions.

## Sync
You can use iCloud and Dropbox to keep your documents safe and synchronised across all your Mac, iPhone and iPad devices. Byword 2 greatly improves syncing reliability and offline support for a seamless experience in all conditions.

## Publish & Export
Byword 2 introduces simple blog publishing for WordPress, Blogger, Tumblr, Evernote and Scriptogram. All your text-based blog posts can now start, evolve and be published without leaving Byword. You can also export to HTML, PDF, and send emails from your Markdown documents.

The bottom line is that with Byword it is seamless to start outlining an idea at night on your iPad, pick up where you left off the next morning on your Mac, then give it a final review on iPhone on your way to get lunch, before sharing your idea with the world.

Now, get on with writing.
