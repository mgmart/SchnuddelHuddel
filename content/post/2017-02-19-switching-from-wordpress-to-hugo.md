I used Wordpress for about 10 years. In those ten years I produced 72
posts. Most of these posts were about audaxes or travels I made. During the
travels I made my posts with the Wordpress iOS client application. Which was
sometimes a hassle because pictures weren't uploaded reliably and I ended up
with missing pictures in my posts.

Vulnerabilities weren't patched frequently and the load of attacks specially on
Wordpress components increased over the time.


# Why Hugo

There are many static site generators out there. The thing most of the
generators have in common is that they are based on some frameworks and you end
up installing runtimes and frameworks before you can begin to work with the
generator itself.

Hugo is a single executable and works out of the box. There are also some themes
available to give you a jump start. 

# The steps

After I'd decided to go away from Wordpress I did some research on the options
I became aware that I could also migrate the existing comments over to static
system by using disqus.

## Using disqus for comments

I did migrate the existing comments to disqus by using
the [Wordpress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/)
which is provided by disqus itself. Within the plugin there is enough
information provided to get the migration step quickly done.

## Convert the existing posts

## Stage everything locally

## Bring it to the server

### Commit only source files

## Posting from iOS
