After I wrote about this topic 2 weeks ago in [[/posting-apple-watch-trainings-to-strava/][my last post]], I made a few changes
to my setup. First of all, I made some changes to [[https://github.com/pilif/GpxExport][GPXExport]] so that it would
better fit my needs. I collected this changes in a new repo and named it
[[https://github.com/mgmart/WorkoutExporter][WorkoutExporter.]] The main change is that WorkoutExporter writes the GPX in a more
readable manner[fn:1].

I also remembered that I experimented in the past with [[https://tapiriik.com][tapiriik]] in the past. I
forgot about it because I did not have a fitting use-case then. Tapiriik
supports syncing with Dropbox. I tried it for a few days and it synced
perfectly the workouts a wrote to a specific Dropbox folder to Strava.

I think this could be a good alternative if one does not want to utilise git for
this.

[fn:1] I need this mainly for debugging reasons. I plan to do some tests where I track the same exercise with a Garmin device and the Apple Watch.
