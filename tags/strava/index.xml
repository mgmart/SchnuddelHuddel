First of all, I made some changes to GPXExport so that it would better fit my needs. I collected this changes in a new repo and named it WorkoutExporter. The main change is that WorkoutExporter writes the GPX in a more readable manner1.
I also remembered that I experimented in the past with tapiriik in the past.</description></item><item><title>Posting Apple Watch Workouts to Strava</title><link>https://schnuddelhuddel.de/posting-apple-watch-trainings-to-strava/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2017 15:44:08 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://schnuddelhuddel.de/posting-apple-watch-trainings-to-strava/</guid><description>Until the latest release to Apple Watch seemed not to be useful to me. But with Apple Watch Series 3 and WatchOS4 several things are fixed. There is no need anymore to carry the phone during exercise and it&amp;#39;s possible to access all training data by HealthKit.
The battery should last for the usual run or short ride. I expect the watch to last at least for a 10h ride.</description></item></channel></rss>
